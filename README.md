<h1>Random Forest Classification Script Documentation</h1>
<p>This documentation covers the usage of the <code>script.py</code> Python script, which performs classification using the Random Forest algorithm.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The script performs data preprocessing, feature selection, and classification on a given dataset. The goal is to train a model to classify data points effectively.</p>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>Before running the script, ensure that the following Python libraries are installed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>pandas (for data manipulation)</li>
    <li>numpy (for numerical operations)</li>
    <li>sklearn (for machine learning tasks)</li>
    <li>graphviz (for visualizing decision trees, if needed)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>The script expects a CSV file named <code>dataset.csv</code> located in the same directory as the script.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Run the script using the following command:</p>
<pre><code>python script.py</code></pre>

<h2>Functionalities</h2>
<h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
<p>The script reads the dataset and prepares it by dropping non-feature columns and separating the features and target variable.</p>

<h3>Feature Selection</h3>
<p>Feature selection is performed using a variance threshold to reduce dimensionality and remove low-variance features.</p>

<h3>Model Training</h3>
<p>The script splits the data into training and test sets, and it is assumed that a Random Forest classifier is then trained on the preprocessed and feature-selected data.</p>

<h3>Model Evaluation</h3>
<p>Performance metrics such as a confusion matrix and classification report are generated to evaluate the classifier's performance.</p>

<h2>Expected Outputs</h2>
<p>The script outputs the performance metrics of the trained classifier and may also output a visual representation of a decision tree (if graphviz is used).</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>The script is a template for Random Forest classification and may require adjustments based on the specifics of the dataset and classification task.</p>
